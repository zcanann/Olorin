/// This file contains every binding between the UI (view) and Rust (view-model).
/// The MVVM pattern is really simple. You have:
/// - A view (.slint files)
/// - A model (squalr libraries)
/// - And a view-model (glue that connects the two)
/// The bindings below are how the view <=> view-model connect to one another.
